## Introduction
<!-- TODO:
   Complete this sentence with a 2-3 sentence summary of what types of data the pipeline ingests, a brief overview of the
   major pipeline sections and the types of output it produces. You're giving an overview to someone new
   to nf-core here, in 15-20 seconds. For an example, see https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/README.md#introduction
-->
**ZS/template** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for a NF template for ZS pipelines.<br>
The pipeline is built using Nextflow, a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The Nextflow DSL2 implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from nf-core/modules in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community! <br>

## Pipeline summary
<!-- TODO:Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core
     workflows use the "tube map" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/guidelines/graphic_design/workflow_diagrams#examples for examples.   -->
<!-- TODO:Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->
1. Read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)) 
2. Present QC for raw reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Quick start

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

<!-- TODO:Describe the minimum required steps to execute the pipeline, e.g. how to prepare samplesheets.
     Explain what rows and columns represent. For instance (please edit as appropriate):

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

-->

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO:update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run ZS/template \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](/docs/usage.md).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](./docs/usage.md) and the [parameter documentation](./nextflow.config).

## Pipeline output

To see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/template/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.
For more details about the output files and reports, please refer to the
[output documentation](./docs/output.md).
